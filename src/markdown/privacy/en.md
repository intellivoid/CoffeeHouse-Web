When you authenticate to CoffeeHouse you are required to use a Intellivoid Account,
from this we keep your Username, Avatar, Tag ID and Subscription Details with
CoffeeHouse, for the purpose of displaying you a dashboard from which you can
manage your API subscription to CoffeeHouse and keep track of your API Usage. This
is also used to validate your access to our API service whenever you make a request
to our API.

For the demos found on CoffeeHouse you will also be required to authenticate to
use them for the purpose of preventing spam, abuse and unofficial access to our
services other than through our API. As explained in our Terms of service, this
violates the agreement.

Each API Request you make to our API Service is logged and a request ID is provided
in the response headers, this is used to keep track on how many requests we get
and what type of requests. This is also used as a method for providing support to 
you because with the request ID we are able to see how the request was handled
and accomplished to troubleshoot any errors or performance issues you may receive.

Each request log contains the following information which we store privately

 - IP Address
 - Subscription Information with CoffeeHouse (Which is linked to your Intellivoid Account)
 - Request Method
 - Request Content
 - Response Time
 - Response body type (JSON, XML, HTML, BLOB, etc.)
 - Server Exception Details (Which are not visible via a API response). This is used to
   debug any issues that may occur during the usage of our API Service
 - Request Path
